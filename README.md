# A Day in the Life

**A Day in the Life** is a one-minute interactive story exploring the emotional challenges and everyday chaos faced by a single immigrant mother trying to navigate city life without a safety net.


Built using **Twine** and the **SugarCube** story format, the interactive story invites players to experience not just the decisions, but the emotional weight behind them.

## Concept

You wake up late. The kids aren’t ready. Daycare drop-off is closing. Your boss won’t understand. One child gets sick. You have no backup, just a phone, your wits, and the fragile balance of a life stretched too thin.

The game explores:
- Care work and emotional labor
- Diaspora and displacement
- The tension between survival and dignity
- Decisions under pressure with no ideal outcomes

## Features

- Emotionally grounded storytelling
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Optional AI-generated dialogue (planned for future versions)
